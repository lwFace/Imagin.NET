Unfortunately, incorporating blending might mean changing the way the layered image is displayed (or rendered). We'd probably need to render the entire image each time any layer is change. Which is probably cool because then there's less UI! It's just a matter of making changes to one bitmap. AND, we can blend layers however we want versus being restricted to how WPF blends two transparent images (which I believe uses standard alpha blending).</Line>
